# Tests Directory

This directory contains test files for verifying the functionality and reliability of the application. A comprehensive testing strategy is critical for:

- Ensuring code correctness and preventing regressions
- Facilitating refactoring by quickly identifying breaking changes
- Documenting expected behavior through test cases
- Improving code quality by forcing modularity and testability
- Providing confidence when deploying new features or changes

The test suite is organized by test type to maintain separation between different testing strategies and to ensure appropriate test coverage at different levels of the application.

## Structure

- **integration/**: Contains integration tests that verify the interaction between different parts of the application.
- **services/**: Contains unit tests for service layer functions.
- **setup.ts**: Contains test setup code for configuring the test environment.
