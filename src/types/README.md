# Types Directory

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions and declarations that enhance the type safety of the application. Strong typing provides several benefits:

- Compile-time error checking that catches potential issues before runtime
- Improved developer experience with better autocomplete and documentation
- Self-documenting code through explicit interfaces and type definitions
- Safer refactoring through type checking
- Extended functionality for third-party libraries through declaration merging

The types in this directory help maintain consistency throughout the codebase and enhance developer productivity by providing clear contracts for data structures and function signatures.
