# Scripts Directory

This directory contains standalone utility scripts that perform specific administrative or maintenance tasks outside the main application flow. These scripts are valuable for:

- Performing one-time data migrations or transformations
- Generating reports and extracting data for analysis
- Automating routine maintenance tasks
- Providing command-line interfaces for administrative functions
- Executing scheduled jobs or batch processes

Unlike the main application code, these scripts are designed to be run directly, typically by administrators or through automated processes like cron jobs.
